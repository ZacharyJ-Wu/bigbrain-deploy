This document outlines the accessibility-related design decisions and improvements implemented in the application, based on the standard lessons covered in lectures.

Semantic HTML Usage

Throughout the application, semantic elements such as <button>, <input>, <label>, and <form> are used via Material UI (MUI) components, which internally adhere to semantic HTML standards.

Typography elements (e.g., <Typography variant="h4">, <Typography variant="body2">) are used to define clear headings and content roles.

Keyboard Accessibility

All interactive components (buttons, forms, checkboxes, etc.) are accessible via keyboard:

Users can tab through input fields and buttons.

Buttons and form fields use native focus behavior, making navigation smooth and predictable.

No custom interactive elements are used that would interfere with standard keyboard navigation.

Form Accessibility

Input fields in forms use associated labels:

<TextField> components include label props, ensuring they are accessible to screen readers.

Validation messages (e.g., missing session ID or name) are displayed using visually distinguishable Alert components.

Visual Feedback and Alerts

The app uses MUI's Alert component to deliver feedback (errors, success) in an accessible manner:

Screen readers can detect alerts with meaningful context.

Alerts use appropriate contrast and color to signal their purpose (e.g., red for errors, green for success).

Logical Focus Flow

Modal dialogs (e.g., for creating a game or copying a session link) trap focus while open and return focus to the triggering element upon close, complying with accessible modal behavior.

Pages have clear visual and logical flow, reducing confusion for keyboard and screen reader users.

Descriptive Buttons and Actions

All buttons and action elements have clear and descriptive text (e.g., "Join Session", "Create", "Stop", "Advance").

This ensures that both screen readers and sighted users understand the purpose of each action without ambiguity.

Color and Contrast

The application uses Material UI’s default color palette, which ensures minimum color contrast ratios are met.

Important states (active sessions, errors, etc.) are not conveyed by color alone — icons, labels, or alerts are also included to support non-color users.

Responsive Layout

The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable across devices, including screen readers and zoom-in accessibility tools.

Images and videos are styled with max-width: 100%, preventing overflow and enabling proper scaling with zoom tools.

Summary
This application demonstrates strong adherence to accessibility principles by:

Using semantic HTML
Ensuring full keyboard navigation
Providing screen reader friendly input fields and alerts
Maintaining color contrast and not relying on color alone
Designing with logical tab and focus flow

These decisions ensure the app can be used effectively by a wide range of users, including those with vision, motor, or cognitive impairments.
